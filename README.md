# Training Camp by Mykhaylo AndriIuka, Google Research

Tittle: **Buiding an Image Search Engine**

Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/computer-vision-training-camp-2021

**Result: 3rd Winner Team**

Abstract:

How could we build an automated system that can find a photograph in a family album or an online photo collection given just a textual description? In this course we will cover fundamental techniques in computer vision and natural language processing that will help us to address this question. The main aim of the course will be to enable students to build their own prototype of the image search engine, and participate in online Kaggle competition organized for the course participants. To aid the students in this mission we will review common methods for representing images and text with neural networks.


Specific techniques that the students will learn:

- Image representation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs)

- Building recurrent neural networks with LSTM and GRU units

- Generating natural language image descriptions (=image captioning)

- Representing words and sentences with vector embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT)
